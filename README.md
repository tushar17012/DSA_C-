# DSA_C-
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It is designed to help developers, students, and enthusiasts to learn, practice, and master various DSA concepts using C++.

Contents
Data Structures:
Arrays
Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
Stacks
Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Segment Tree, etc.)
Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, etc.)
Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
Hash Tables
Tries
Algorithms:
Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Coding, Kruskal’s Algorithm, etc.)
Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, etc.)
Backtracking (N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, etc.)
Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-in-Cpp.git
cd DSA-in-Cpp
Compile and Run:
Each data structure and algorithm is located in its respective folder with a corresponding test file. Navigate to the desired folder and compile the code using a C++ compiler.

sh
Copy code
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
How to Use
Learning: Use this repository as a reference to understand how various data structures and algorithms are implemented in C++.
Practice: Try to implement the algorithms by yourself and then compare with the provided implementations.
Projects: Feel free to use these implementations in your own projects.
